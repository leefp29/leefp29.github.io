The four-dimensional (4D) quantum chromodynamics (QCD) equation of state (EoS) constitutes a fundamental input for hydrodynamic investigations of QCD matter under extreme conditions. In this study, we extend our previously developed Deep-Learning Quasi-Parton Gas Model (DLQPM) to incorporate both charge chemical potential ($\mu_Q$) and strangeness chemical potential ($\mu_S$) using the most recent lattice QCD (LQCD) data. This extension yields a comprehensive DLQPM framework capable of characterizing the 4D QCD EoS. Our results indicate that the 4D DLQPM not only precisely reproduces the susceptibilities $\chi_{i,j,k}^{B,Q,S}$ at vanishing chemical potentials ($\mu_X$=0 where $X$ = $B$, $Q$, $S$), but also accurately describes the QCD EoS at finite $\mu_X$ when compared with the generalized $T^{\prime}$-expansion method. Additionally, the DLQPM provides a consistent interpretation of the recently measured baryon-strangeness correlation coefficients ($C_{BS}$) reported by the RHIC-STAR collaboration.
