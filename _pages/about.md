I am currently a PhD student studying at [Central China Normal University](https://www.ccnu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Prof. Long-Gang Pang, and my main research interests are in the application of machine learning to inverse problems in nuclear physic. For more personal information check out my [CV](https://leefp29.github.io/cv)!

Machine Learning&Deep Learning&Nuclear Physics
======
1. Machine Learning as a subset of Artificial Intelligence has been successfully used in a wide range of research fields. For more explanation about it check out the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).
2. Nuclear physics, a fundamental discipline in physics, focuses on the microstructure as well as the fundamental properties of matter.In recent years, there has been an increasing sophistication of research that combines methodological applications of machine learning with nuclear physics.
3. For literature related to this cross-cutting area you can refer to [this website](https://iml-wg.github.io/HEPML-LivingReview/).

Heavy-ion collisions
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section

Quantum Chromodynamics(QCD)
======
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
