I am currently a PhD student studying at [Central China Normal University](https://www.ccnu.edu.cn/) under the supervision of Prof. Long-Gang Pang, and my main research interests are in the application of machine learning to inverse problems in nuclear physic. For more personal information check out my [CV](https://leefp29.github.io/cv)!

Machine Learning&Deep Learning&Nuclear Physics
======
1. Machine Learning as a subset of Artificial Intelligence has been successfully used in a wide range of research fields. For more explanation about it check out the [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning).
2. Nuclear physics, a fundamental discipline in physics, focuses on the microstructure as well as the fundamental properties of matter.In recent years, there has been an increasing sophistication of research that combines methodological applications of machine learning with nuclear physics.
3. For literature related to this cross-cutting area you can refer to [this website](https://iml-wg.github.io/HEPML-LivingReview/).

Heavy-ion collisions
======
1. The heavy ion collision is an experiment in which two atomic nuclei are accelerated to near the speed of light to collide. The products of the final state are observed by detectors and physically analysed so that certain important physical information about the initial state and the reaction process can be deduced. Examples include the nuclear structure of the initial state, the equation of state in the high density region, and the jet quenching.
2. At present, the world's major high-energy heavy ion accelerators are the [RHIC](https://www.bnl.gov/rhic/) in the United States, the [LHC](https://home.cern/science/accelerators/large-hadron-collider) in Europe and the [HIAF](https://english.imp.cas.cn/research/facilities/HIAF/) in China (soon to be completed).
3. For those interested in HICs, check out [this review](https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-nucl-101917-020852).

Quantum Chromodynamics(QCD)
======
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
